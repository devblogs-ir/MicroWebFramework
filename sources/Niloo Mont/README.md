Niloo Mont Here [About Me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niloufar-mont/)
I'm a dotnet enthusiast, I'm looking for chances to boost my know-how and abilities.

# MicroWebFramework
A httpListenere that listens for requests and runs them through a pipleline with three pipes that routes urls semi-dynamically and handles exceptions and authentication.

**You can try these URLs like:**
```
http://localhost:7776/Products/GetAllProducts
http://localhost:7776/Products/GetUserById/{id}
http://localhost:7776/Orders/GetAllOrders
http://localhost:7776/Orders/GetOrderById/{id}
```
